Local only password locker build in Python. Supported by Windows and Linux, built originally for use on RasperianOS.

To run the program:
1. Ensure python is installed (intended version 3.7.3)
2. Modify the settings.psl (using any text editor) file and set sffpsl and fileloc to appropriate path locations
3. Run Main.py via 'py Main.py'
4. Follow instructions output by the program (to use the in-app config editor, use the command '-config help' at any time)

Enjoy.
